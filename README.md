# Junior Data Scientist Take-Home Assignment

## 🎯 Objective
Welcome! We want to see how you handle a typical end-to-end data problem. Your goal is to build a regression model to predict the **delivery time (in minutes)** for an e-commerce platform.

We value **clean code**, **logical thinking**, and **proper usage of libraries** (specifically Pandas and Scikit-Learn pipelines) over getting the "perfect" metric score.

## ⏳ Time Commitment
This assignment is designed to be completed in **approx. 2 to 3 hours**. We recommend breaking it down over a few days (e.g., 20 mins/day).

## 🛠️ Setup
1. **Clone this repository.**
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Generate the dataset:
   Run the python script provided to create your raw data file (`delivery_data.csv`).
   ```bash
   python src/generate_data.py
   ```

## 📦 Submission Instructions
1. Fork this repository.
2. Push your solution (Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts) to your fork.
3. Share your repository to MAXIMS-GLIM & email the link to your repository to `glim@mxcaterers.com.sg`.
